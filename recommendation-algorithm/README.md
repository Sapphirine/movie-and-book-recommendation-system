We deal with two parts data: movie and book
In both movie and book, we implement algorithms to:
(1) perform collaborative filtering;
(2) perform association rule extraction;
(3) generate recommendation list for users.

There are slightly difference between code for movie and books, for example, for movie dataâ€™s collaborative filtering, we only care about user locations, but for book data, we need update both user locations and book locations.
